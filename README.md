# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using JavaScript. Itâ€™s a fun little project where you play against the computer, and the computer randomly picks its move every time you play.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
2. Youâ€™ll be asked to enter your choice: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.  
3. The computer will also pick its choice randomly.  
4. The game will tell you who won or if itâ€™s a draw.  

_Simple and fun!_

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

A JavaScript file (`game.js`) that handles:  
- Picking a random choice for the computer  
- Asking for your choice via a prompt  
- Comparing choices to decide the winner  
- Showing the result using alerts  

## How to Run

Just open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), and the game will start automatically.
